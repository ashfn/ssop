This project will be a extremely simple typescript oidc provider using the oidc package server configured with JSON files. There will be a users file and a clients file, both are read at boot and never written to. Format will have hashed passwords, roles and metadata like profile photos etc. Clients will have neccesary details like secrets etc. I want you to use a secure password hash but one that can be easily computed in a terminal command so its easy for people to generate users. On startup if theres an invalid config it should not continue and show the error. A simple login page will be shown, we will use expressjs. The server must be fully functional and be able to be used with common oauth clients like gitea or grafana etc.
